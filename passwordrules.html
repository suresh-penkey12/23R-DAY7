    <pre><p><b>Create strong passwords:</b>

        <b>1)</b>Password security starts with creating a strong password. A strong password is:
        
        <b>2)</b>At least 12 characters long but 14 or more is better.
        
        <b>3)</b>A combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
        
        <b>4)</b>Not a word that can be found in a dictionary or the name of a person, character, product, or organization.
        
        <b>5)</b>Significantly different from your previous passwords.
        
        <b>6)</b>Easy for you to remember but difficult for others to guess. Consider using a memorable phrase like "6MonkeysRLooking^".</p></pre>
